The main DAT modules are on this directory. Extra modules required for functioning are on the modules directory, and synthetized verilog files are on the synth directory.

SIMULATIONS:
For running simulations, just run make command (on any GNU/Linux distro). "run clean" will delete object files and .vcd files
